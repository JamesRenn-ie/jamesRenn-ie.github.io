    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project focused on designing serial, parallel, and distributed versions of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. The aim was to benchmark performance improvements by leveraging multithreading and distributed systems for large-scale grid simulations.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Serial implementation for baseline performance comparison.</li>
      <li>Parallel processing using Go's Goroutines and channels for efficient multithreading.</li>
      <li>Distributed computing implementation with workload distribution across AWS instances.</li>
      <li>Benchmarking and analysis of speedup and scalability.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>Implementing efficient grid partitioning for distributed computing was a significant challenge, especially in ensuring minimal communication overhead between nodes. Optimizing Goroutines to avoid bottlenecks in the parallel version was also critical for performance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming Language: Go</li>
      <li>Concurrency: Goroutines and Channels</li>
      <li>Distributed Computing: AWS Instances</li>
