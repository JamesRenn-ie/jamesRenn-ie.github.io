      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project involved the design and implementation of an AI to play the classic board game <strong>Scotland Yard</strong>. The AI was built to efficiently strategize movements, predict opponents' moves, and optimize gameplay to either evade or catch the target player.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Object-oriented design in Java for maintainable and scalable code.</li>
        <li>Pathfinding algorithms to optimize moves on the game board.</li>
        <li>Opponent prediction logic using heuristic analysis.</li>
        <li>Efficient decision-making algorithms for dynamic game scenarios.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>One of the primary challenges was implementing an efficient pathfinding algorithm that could operate within the constraints of the game's dynamic state. Additionally, predicting the moves of multiple opponents required the development of a robust heuristic evaluation system.</p>
